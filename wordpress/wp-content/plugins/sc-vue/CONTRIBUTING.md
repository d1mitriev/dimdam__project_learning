## Contributing to SC-Vue ##

Here are some suggested areas:

* *Testing with various WordPress versions.* The plugin was developed
  on WordPress 5.4. It has not been tested with other versions.

* *Installation of Vue.js app to database.* Instead of adding files
  index.js and index.html, save their content to the database.

* *Vue.js app as custom block.* Ideally Vue.js apps would be available
  as custom blocks in the block editor.

* *Vue.js app catalog.* Some way to browse and explore installed Vue.js
  apps.

* *Better parameter passing mechanism.* It would be nice to have typed
  parameter values, and perhaps lists and hashes too.
